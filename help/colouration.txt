colouration
-----------------------------------------------


I’ve developed a possible to edit the colouration of a stability map. There 
are 4 different colouration modes, so that almost every user should be 
satisfied. 

There is a “radio button” and a submenu for every of the 4 colouration modes. 
In addition to that you can find a button to close this window on its bottom. 
By clicking on one of the “radio buttons” you can select the colouration 
mode. The first colouration mode is called “spectral mode” and you can chose 
between 2 sub-modes which are the same just mirrored. The title refers to the 
appearance of the mode, because it looks like a spectrum. In the submenu for 
the second mode, that is called “two colour” you can find 2 “shapes”. By 
clicking on them you can change their colour with a colour dialog. The 
colouration makes an RGB-interpolation between those two colours. 

The next mode is called “RGB mode” and its submenu contains 2 “radio buttons”, 
3 “check boxes”, 6 “text edits” and another submenu that consists of 6 
“radio buttons”. With the first 2 “radio buttons” you can select the 
sub-mode: the first mode “mixed” is similar to the “two colour” mode, but the 
other mode draws a sequence of RGB colours with different intensity. You can 
enable and disable single colours (red, green or blue) with the 3 
“check boxes”. With the “radio buttons” in the other submenu you can change 
the order of the sequence. In the 6 “text edits” you can enter the intervals 
for the main colours.

The last colouration mode is quiet simple. It loads a colour sequence from 
the colour palette, we have already treated above.
