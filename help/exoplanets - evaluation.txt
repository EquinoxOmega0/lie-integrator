exoplanets - evaluation
-----------------------------------------------------------


Now we can evaluate the results of the previous calculation. For this I’ve 
developed another window, where you can investigate the exoplanetary system 
in two different ways.

This window contains of 2 submenus, a “spin edit” to set the number of 
visible right-of-comma positions for the data that will be display in the 
“memo field” in the lower left corner, a “paint box” and 6 buttons. The 
first of these buttons has been placed there to open the result file of an 
exoplanet calculation. The other two buttons in the first row start the two 
evaluation procedures. In the second row the first button closes this window. 
The next one which is labelled “save data” saves the content of the 
“memo field” to a text file. The last button saves the diagram from the 
“paint box” to a bitmap by clicking. The first submenu is titled 
“radial-velocity curve – settings” and contains 6 “text edits” and a 
“check box”. You can define the time interval that will be displayed with the 
first two “text edits”. The next two “text edit” give the values for the 
borders of the y-axis (radial velocity). The inclination angle which influences 
the amplitude of the curve has to be entered into the “text edit”. Into the 
last “text edit” there can be the angle of the fix point entered. Finally if 
you click on the “check box” there will be an output of into the “memo field” 
as well as to the “paint box”. The other submenu is titled 
“variation of orbit elements – settings”. It consists of 2 “list boxes”. The 
first one lists up the first three orbit elements, while the other contains a 
list of objects in this system. By starting the evaluation the program will 
search maxima and minima due to the selection and output the variation of the 
orbit elements into the “memo field”.
