resonances
----------------------------------------------


Investigating resonances is a very common work in Astrodynamics. 
Resonances are important in our own solar system (e.g. main asteroid 
belt and Kuiper belt) as well as in other multipanetary systems (in 
Classes Ia and Ib due to the classification of S. Ferraz-Mello ). 
Because I intent to make the NLI as user-friendly as possible, I have 
created a feature which calculates resonances for scientific users so 
that they don’t have to do side-calculations. 

The window only contains 2 “spin edits”, 2 “text edits”, 3 buttons 
and a couple of “labels”. With the 2 “spin edits” you are able to 
choose the resonance ratio. Furthermore you can enter into the first 
“text edit” the semi-major axis of the object you want to have a 
resonance with. The last “text edit” is designated to the width of 
resonance. In most cases it is reasonable to investigate the exact 
resonance only. So you have to define a small area around it to see the 
structure of the resonance. The first button is titled “pre-calculate” 
and when clicking it calculates the resonance but only makes an output 
into the bottommost “label”. The button “accept” also calculates the 
resonance but closes the window and enters the result into the scan 
window. You can simply close this window with the last button.
