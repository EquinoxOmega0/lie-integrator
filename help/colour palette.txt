colour palette
--------------------------------------------------


It doesn’t only look boring to have a monochromatic diagram; no it can 
even cause problems, because you will mix up the graphs if they cross 
over. So I’ve programmed a Colour palette to give the user the 
opportunity to select the colours for the individual curves. 
Furthermore I use this window in other parts of the program, where 
it’s reasonable that the user can select colours. The colour palette 
used to colour a stability map or the objects in the 3D-animation. 

This window consists of a “list box”, 5 buttons and a “shape”. The 
last object is usually used to display simple geometric figures, 
like in this case a rectangle. But it can also be coloured in any 
available 32bit colour and a “shape” can also react on an 
“on click-event”. When you click on this “shape” a simple colour 
dialog as known from programs like “Paint” will show up and you are 
able to change its colour. By clicking on the button “add colour” 
the recent colour of the “shape” will be added to the “list box”. 
You can remove a colour from the “list box” by first clicking on the 
colour you want to get rid of and then clicking on the button which is 
labelled “remove colour”. With the buttons “move up” and “move down” 
you can sort the “list box”. The final button “close” closes the 
window so that you can continue with your work. Note that all colours 
are display in the “list box” in their hexadecimal RGB 
(red-green-blue) code (or better BGR).
