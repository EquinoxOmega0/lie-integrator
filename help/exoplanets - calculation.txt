exoplanets - calculation
------------------------------------------------------------


A Keplerian fit to determine the orbit elements is not always valid. So I’ve 
decided a feature to check its validity by calculating an artificial radial 
velocity curve for exoplanetary systems. You just enter the parameters of 
the system you intend to investigate into the main menu and open this window. 

This window is small and simple: into the first submenu you have to enter 
the resolution of your calculation in. The program looks for the planet with 
the smallest semi-major axis and divides its orbit period by the value you 
have entered into this “text edit”. The next submenu is designated for the 
duration of this calculation. I’ve decide to place this “text edit” here to 
avoid that the user makes the mistake to start this calculation at such a 
high resolution over a million years. This would simply take to much time. 
The last submenu contains a “text edit” and a button that is labelled 
“change path”. Similar to the scan you have to select a path for this 
calculation which can be done by clicking on this button and the selected 
path will appear in the “text edit”. Finally there are two more buttons on 
the bottommost edge of this window. The first one starts a calculation and 
the other closes this window.
