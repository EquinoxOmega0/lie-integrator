stable elements
---------------------------------------------------


The program must know when it draws a diagram or stability map from a 
scan-file on what values the non-variable parameters are held. For 
this problem I’ve created the stable elements window, where you can 
select these values.

This window contains 7 labelled “spin edits” and a button to close 
this window again. With these “spin edits” you can set the counter 
position for the elements that have been variable during the scan, but 
are not displayed on an axis in the diagram. Reasonable values are 
from one up to the resolution of the orbit element. In case you’ve 
entered in a not allowed value it will either take 1 or the highest 
reasonable value for this element.
